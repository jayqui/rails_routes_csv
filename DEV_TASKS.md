# Development Tasks

- [x] **Initialize the Gem:** Use `bundler` to generate a standard directory structure for the new gem, `rails_routes_csv`.
- [x] **Define Dependencies:** Specify the necessary dependencies in the `rails_routes_csv.gemspec` file. This gem will need `railties` to integrate with Rails.
- [x] **Create the Rake Task:** Create a Rake task in `lib/tasks/routes.rake`. This task will contain the logic to:
  - [x] Access all the application's routes.
  - [x] Format the route information (verb, path, controller, action, prefix).
  - [x] Generate a CSV file named `routes.csv` in the root of the Rails application.
- [x] **Integrate with Rails:** Use a `Railtie` to automatically load the new Rake task into any Rails application that includes the gem.
- [ ] **Documentation:** 
  - [ ] Write a `README.md` to explain how to install and use the gem.
    - [ ] explain how to set this up in one's gemfile
    - [ ] explain how to run it `bin/rails routes:csv`, and any/all command line options
    - [ ] add an accurate Contributing section
  - [x] Correct missing documentation in `rails_routes_csv.gemspec`
- [ ] **Finesse features:**
  - [ ] ~~add a command line option(s) to exclude built-in Rails things~~
    - [ ] ~~to exclude any URL pattern provided by Rails (including `/rails/*`, or the Turbo-related URL patterns (`/*historical_location`)~~
  - [ ] ~~add a help command that shows further available options and shows up when one types `bin/rails routes:csv --help`~~
- [ ] **Ergonomics:**
  - [x] Configure Rubocop
    - [x] run it and do auto-corrections
  - [ ] add pre-commit hooks
    - [ ] For Rubocop
- [x] **Testing:** Set up a testing framework and write tests to ensure the Rake task works as expected.
    - [ ] Run test suite
    - [ ] Set up CI in GitHub
    - [ ] Run Rubocop in GitHub
